# Getting started with AWS Amplify to deploy and host any web application.

I have recently used AWS Amplify to host the project that I was working on as a part of 2 months virtual internship at Amazon.

The repository for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/sandeepism/Service-provider-approval-mechanism).

```
AWS Amplify is a development platform for building secure, scalable mobile and web applications.
It provides a Git based workflow for deploying and hosting fullstack serverless web applications.
```

This repository was used to host a sample react application using AWS Amplify and the required steps and screenshots are documented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iPotGz0AvVoHFuJqJ9KbFtgE2MnFdvzCw_n-5_b7IWA/edit?usp=sharing).
